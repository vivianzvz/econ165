<h2>Welcome to the Part 3 of the Study</h2>

<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    There are two stages in this part.
</p>

<ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <li><strong>Block 1</strong>: A single-round interaction between an employer and a worker. <br>
        <em>Instructions will appear before Block 1 begins.</em></li>
    <li><strong>Block 2</strong>: A multi-round interaction with new roles and decisions. <br>
        <em>Instructions will appear before Block 2 begins.</em></li>
</ul>

<p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    Your total earnings will be the sum of your Block 1 payoff and a randomly selected round from Block 2.
